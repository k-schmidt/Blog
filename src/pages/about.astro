<BaseLayout pageTitle={pageTitle} description="About Kyle Schmidt — Data Engineer based in the USA. Skills in JavaScript, React, Astro, and more. Passionate about data engineering, AI, and software development.">
  <p>I build the data systems that help Meta decide where to invest $70+ billion in infrastructure each year. As a Tech Lead and Data Engineering Manager, I lead teams that turn complexity into clarity—transforming massive-scale data challenges into the foundation for smarter decisions.</p>

  <p>But my approach to life extends well beyond the data center.</p>

  <p>I'm a former US National Team rower with a Columbia math degree and a persistent drive to optimize everything—from data pipelines to dinner party menus. Whether I'm deep in a data architecture problem or planning my next travel adventure, I'm drawn to systems that reward precision, discipline, and big-picture thinking.</p>

  <p>When I'm not building capacity planning infrastructure, you'll find me hosting friends for game nights, crushing a Barry's Bootcamp class, logging zone-2 miles on a Saturday long run, or researching which small town has the perfect mix of hiking trails, great food, and a lake worth visiting.</p>

  <p>I believe the best leaders are equal parts analytical and human—that clear thinking and genuine connection aren't competing priorities, they're multipliers.</p>
