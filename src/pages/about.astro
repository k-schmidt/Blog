<BaseLayout pageTitle={pageTitle} description="About Kyle Schmidt — Data Engineer based in the USA. Skills in JavaScript, React, Astro, and more. Passionate about data engineering, AI, and software development.">
  <p>At Meta, I lead the Planning Data Foundation and Capacity Planning Data Engineering team. My work sits at the intersection of technical excellence and business impact—building the data infrastructure that powers some of the largest infrastructure investment decisions in tech.</p>

  <p>My path here wasn't traditional. I competed on the US National Rowing Team before pivoting to tech through Columbia's Applied Math program and Insight Data Science. That athletic background shaped how I approach leadership: with discipline, collaboration, and a relentless focus on measurable outcomes.</p>

  <p>I'm driven by the opportunity to shape how organizations think about data strategy, governance, and quality at scale. Looking ahead, I'm building toward senior data leadership—Head of Data Product, or VP of Data—where I can influence how companies leverage data as a strategic asset.</p>
